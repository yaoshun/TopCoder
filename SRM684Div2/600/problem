Problem Statement
    
Hero likes some arrays. The arrays he likes are the arrays that have all of the following properties:
The length of the array is n.
Each element is an integer between 1 and k, inclusive.
Whenever A and B are two consecutive elements of the array (in this order), we have (A <= B) or (A mod B != 0).
For example, suppose n=4 and k=7. Hero will like the array {1,7,7,2} because it has the right length, all elements are in the correct range, 1 <= 7, 7 <= 7, and 7 mod 2 != 0. Hero will not like the array {4,4,4,2}.
You are given the ints n and k. Let X be the number of different arrays Hero likes. Compute and return the value (X mod 1,000,000,007).

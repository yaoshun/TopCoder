Problem Statement
    
The level-M weight of a permutation P, denoted W(P,M), is computed by finding the number of cycles of P and then taking that number to the M-th power. For example, the level-3 weight of a permutation with 5 cycles is 5^3.
The total level-M weight of all permutations on N elements, denoted T(N,M), is computed as the sum of W(P,M) over all N! possible permutations P on N elements.
You are given multiple queries. These are encoded as two vector <int>s n and m with the same number of elements. Return a vector <int> with the same number of elements as n. For each valid i, element i of the return value should be the value T( n[i], m[i] ) modulo 1,000,000,007.

Notes
-
Formally, a permutation on N elements is a bijective function P defined on an N-element set S.
-
A cycle of a permutation is a sequence c[0], c[1], ..., c[k-1] of distinct elements of S such that for each i, P(c[i]) = c[(i+1) mod k].
Constraints
-
n and m will contain the same number of elements.
-
n will contain between 1 and 300 elements, inclusive.
-
Each element of n will be between 1 and 100,000, inclusive.
-
Each element of m will be between 0 and 300, inclusive.
Examples
0)

    
{2}
{2}
Returns: {5 }
Here are two permutations: (1, 2) and (2, 1). (1, 2) have 2 cycles. (2, 1) has one cycle. So answer is 1 * 1 + 2 * 2 = 5.
1)

    
{3}
{0}
Returns: {6 }
Here answer is just number of permutations, 3! = 6.
2)

    
{1, 2, 3}
{1, 3, 3}
Returns: {1, 9, 53 }
Could be more than one query.
3)

    
{10, 20, 30}
{10, 20, 30}
Returns: {586836447, 544389755, 327675273 }
Do not forget take answers modulo 1,000,000,007.

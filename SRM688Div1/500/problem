Problem Statement
    
Correct parentheses sequences can be defined recursively as follows:
The empty string "" is a correct sequence.
If "X" and "Y" are correct sequences, then "XY" (the concatenation of X and Y) is a correct sequence.
If "X" is a correct sequence, then "(X)" is a correct sequence.
Each correct parentheses sequence can be derived using the above rules.
Examples of correct parentheses sequences include "", "()", "()()()", "(()())", and "(((())))".   You are given a string s. You are also given vector <int>s L and R, each with the same number of elements. These encode a set of conditions. For each valid i, you have to satisfy the following condition: the substring of s that begins at the 0-based index L[i] and ends at the 0-based index R[i] must be a correct parentheses sequence.   You can only modify s in one way: in each step you can choose two characters of s and swap them. Return the minimal number of swaps needed to produce a string that satisfies all the given conditions. If it is impossible, return -1 instead.

Constraints
-
s will contain between 1 and 2,000 characters, inclusive.
-
Each character in s will be '(' or ')'.

Examples
0)

    
")("
{0,0,0,0}
{1,1,1,1}
Returns: 1
We have four identical conditions. Each of them tells us that the substring that begins at index 0 and ends at index 1 must be a correct parentheses sequence. We can satisfy all conditions by swapping s[0] with s[1]. This swap produces the string "()".
1)

    
"(())"
{0,2}
{1,3}
Returns: 1
The only way to satisfy both conditions is to change s into "()()". This can be done in 1 swap: by swapping s[1] with s[2].
2)

    
"(((())"
{0,2}
{1,3}
Returns: 2
This time we do swap(s[1],s[4]) and swap(s[3],s[5]).
3)

    
"((((((((("
{0,2}
{1,3}
Returns: -1

4)

    
"()()()()"
{0,0,0,0,2,2,2,4,4,6}
{1,3,5,7,3,5,7,5,7,7}
Returns: 0

5)

    
")()(()()((())()()()()()()))(()())()()()("
{3,5,17,25,35}
{12,10,30,30,38}
Returns: 3

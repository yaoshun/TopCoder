Problem Statement
    
A set of positive integers is called k-smooth if each pair (A,B) of elements of the set satisfies A <= k * B. For example, the set {3,4,7,9} is 3-smooth but the set {30,60,100} is not: 100 is strictly more than 3 * 30.
Hero likes some sets of integers. In order to determine whether he likes a set S, Hero uses the following procedure:
Form a new set D of pairwise differences of elements in S. In other words: for each pair of elements A, B in S, put the number |A-B| into D.
Hero likes the original set S if and only if the new set D is k-smooth.
You are given a vector <int> a containing a set of distinct integers. You are also given the int k Hero uses while determining whether he likes a set of integers.
Select the largest subset of a Hero likes. Return the number of elements in that subset.
